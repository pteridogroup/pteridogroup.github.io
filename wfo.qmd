## About WFO

[World Flora Online (**WFO**)](https://about.worldfloraonline.org/) is a digital flora including all land plants(bryophytes and vascular plants).
It was initiated during the 11th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in October 2012 in response to Target 1 ("An online flora of all known plants") of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC) of the U.N. Convention on Biological Diversity.

The WFO is a [collaborative, international project](https://about.worldfloraonline.org/who-we-are) that is supported by multiple institutions, including the Missouri Botanical Garden, the New York Botanical Garden, the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.

WFO data are widely used, including major databases such as [Catalog of Life (CoL)](https://www.catalogueoflife.org/) and the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)](https://www.gbif.org/).

## About TENs

WFO does not take a "top-down" approach to taxonomy.
Rather, the data in WFO are maintained by [Taxonomic Expert Networks, or **TENs**](https://about.worldfloraonline.org/tens).
Each TEN is composed of expert taxonomists for a certain group of plants (for example, [Fabaceae](https://about.worldfloraonline.org/tens/fabaceae)).

[PPG is the TEN for ferns and lycophytes in WFO](https://about.worldfloraonline.org/tens/pteridophyte-phylogeny-group).

## Accessing WFO data

The WFO data may be accessed from <https://www.worldfloraonline.org/> or <https://wfoplantlist.org/>.

These two websites show the most recent **snapshot** (version) of the data.
Snapshots are taken twice per year, at the solstices (December and June).

Note that once a snapshot is taken, <https://wfoplantlist.org/> gets updated first; <https://www.worldfloraonline.org/> is also updated, but lags by a few weeks to months.
