    "section": "Background information",
    "text": "Background information\n\nAbout repos\nA repository (or “repo” for short) is a project—a collection of files in a single folder (that may contain subfolders) that is tracked by a piece of version-control software called “git”. Git can be thought of as a fancy “undo” tool—it keeps track of all previous versions of your documents so you can always go back to earlier versions if you want to. GitHub is a web service to host repos in the cloud (online) so that anybody can access them. For our purposes, one need not know anything about git—just think of GitHub as a website that can host our classification and our discussions.\n\n\nAbout issues\nIssues are the tool that GitHub uses to track “to-do” items related to the project. A repo will have a list of issues (like a to-do list), each of which can be open or closed. Open issues still need to be completed. Closed issues have been resolved. Issues can be commented on in a discussion, and the discussion will remain online in perpetuity, even after the issue is closed.\n\n\nAbout markdown\nWhen you create a new issue or add a comment on an existing issue, you can only use plain text (no bold, italics, etc). In order to add formatting, you need to use a syntax called markdown. In markdown, you indicate how the text should be formatted with special characters, such as asterisks around words to be shown in italics. That is why any dialog box to enter text in GitHub has two tabs, “Write” and “Preview”. You enter the text in the “Write” tab and click on “Preview” to see how the formatted text will appear. For more on writing with markdown, see this help doc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: No markdown needed\n\n\n\nIf you don’t want to bother with markdown formatting, you don’t need to use it! Feel free just to write with plain text."

    "text": "Phase One\nThe goal of Phase One is to update the PPG I (2016) genus-and-above classification of ferns and lycophytes.\n\nIntended products\nThe primary product of Phase One will be a peer-reviewed publication (PPG II) with all PPG contributors included as authors, similar to PPG I (2016). This publication will also include elements of Phase Two, such as an online supplement providing the data in a standard format (Darwin Core). In addition to a different decision-making process, this publication will differ from PPG I (2016) in that we will explicitly discuss minority opinions (defined as those with at least ⅙ votes against).\n\n\nGitHub interface for communication and coordination\nPPG II will be constructed communally using the online hosting service GitHub, which will provide all PPG members the opportunity to make proposals and to comment on them, and will additionally archive all proposals and discussion in perpetuity. GitHub is easy to use, the only requirement being that each participant needs to create a free account; detailed instructions are available in the GitHub Guide. If any PPG members are not comfortable participating in this format, they can send proposals to any of the PPG coordinators, who can then post that proposal on their behalf. There are two primary activities supported by our PPG GitHub site: 1) A discussion forum, for the discussion of any matter pteridophyte-related, including PPG organization, etc; 2) A proposal forum (known as “Issues” in GitHub parlance), where anyone can propose a modification to the PPG I classification, and where those proposals can then be discussed. Voting on proposals will happen after the discussion period, via a Google Forms survey circulated on the PPG mailing list.\n\n\nGuidelines for effective proposals\nMuch of the success of Phase One will depend on PPG members making clear and informative proposals. For example, we want to avoid a set of similar proposals that differ only in their argumentation while proposing the same or similar changes. With that goal in mind, please follow these guidelines (if a proposal does not meet at least the first two guidelines below it may be removed from consideration without a vote):\n\nAny higher-level taxon (genus and above) proposed for recognition needs to be published (taxa “in press”, etc., are not allowed). Similarly, all supporting studies should be published. For example, if one is advocating for a name change based upon the non-monophyly of a taxon recognized in PPG I (2016), the phylogeny demonstrating non-monophyly needs to be published.\nEach proposal should take PPG I (2016) as the starting point (i.e., only changes to PPG I should be proposed).\nProposals to recognize nothotaxa should only be made if the parent taxa are already recognized.\nEach proposal should be cohesive and self-contained—try to avoid compound proposals where possible. Proposing a different set of genera within a family, for example, would be appropriate because the new generic circumscriptions depend on each other. However, proposing the recognition of two unrelated generic treatments should be done with two separate proposals.\nAnyone is welcome to make a proposal for any taxon, but it would be collegial to allow the researchers most closely associated with the name change “first dibs”, so to speak. These people are also probably in the best position to write a comprehensive proposal.\nEach proposal should be comprehensive: it should include all relevant details to allow other PPG members to make an informed decision about the proposal. Those details include summaries (with citations) of the arguments supporting a particular proposal, and, ideally, a discussion of the main counter arguments. Take the time to write a comprehensive proposal the first time, so that there is no need to mention additional information during the discussion—the proposal itself should ideally contain all the information that PPG members need to come to a conclusion.\nPlease only submit proposals that you personally think deserve recognition in PPG and can vouch for during the discussion. It is not necessary to submit a proposal simply because it is a nomenclaturally valid alternative. There are countless alternative ways to devise the taxonomy; we should only spend our time voting on those that our members feel are worthy of recognition. If you don’t feel strongly either way about a particular taxonomic treatment but would like to ask what others think, please start a discussion.\n\nAny proposal not meeting the guidelines may be removed from consideration for voting.\n\n\nGuidelines for effective discussion\nTo promote informative and respectful discussion of the proposals, please follow these guidelines when commenting on a proposal:\n\nEach comment should be substantive and contain new information or new perspectives. Simple statements of support (or resistance) should be avoided (that’s what the voting is for), as should back-and-forths between individuals.\nEach comment should be limited to statements about the merit of the specific proposal itself, and not about the people involved (individual personalities, whether those making the proposal, or other people involved in the discussions, are not appropriate subjects for discussion).\nAll proposals and discussions must abide by the Code of Conduct.\n\n\n\nVoting\nAfter each proposal has been available for discussion for one month, a vote will be taken. This vote will only be available to PPG members (people on the PPG mailing list), and will be administered with Google Forms (for those unable to access Google Forms a separate ballot will be sent by email). Voting will commence on the 1st of the month following the discussion period and close on the last day of that month. After each vote, the final results will be posted to the proposal, and the vote itself will be archived. All proposals receiving &gt;⅔ of the votes will be deemed accepted by the PPG community.\n\n\nData sources\nOur initial database is based on Michael Hassler’s World Ferns list (thank you Michael!). Joel Nitta has written a script that converts this list into Darwin Core format. Note that this database includes various changes relative to PPG I (2016) made by Michael, but none of these will be considered official until they have been approved via the process outlined above.\nAs of 2025-06, the data have been imported into World Flora Online and are maintained using their online taxonomic database editor, Rhakhis."

This refers to the data as specified in PPG I (2016), and we have no intention of issuing changes within v1 (e.g., v1.1.0). Rather, the next update will be v2.0.0, to be released at the completion of Phase One.\n“PPG I”, “PPG II”, etc. can be used to refer to any version starting with that first digit (e.g., v1.0.0, v2.0.0, respectively). However, it will be preferable in publications to reference the exact version number (and DOI) for a given version of the data (e.g., “PPG v2.1.0” instead of “PPG II”).\nThe database maintainer (currently Joel Nitta) will be in charge of issuing updates. The PPG community will be notified before any major updates. Only changes that have been approved by the voting system will be included in updates. A DOI will be provided for each version via Zenodo."

    "text": "Version 1.0.0, 2023-05-09\nThe Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group (PPG) is committed to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone.\nWe strive to cultivate a community with shared values, where people are comfortable exploring ideas, asking questions, and saying things like “I don’t understand” or “why”. We assume competence in our participants and collaborators. There are no stupid questions.\nWe aim to keep discussions productive and civil. Spamming discussions with off-topic comments are not tolerated.\nWe will be considerate in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of people who participate in PPG activities.\nWe will take care of each other. We will alert a member of the Code of Conduct Committee if we notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or a potential violation of this Code of Conduct, even if it seems inconsequential.\nWe do not tolerate harassment in any form. Adherence to our Code of Conduct requires refraining from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech including, but not limited to:\n\noffensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), nationality, native language, or technology choices;\nunwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, or employment;\nsustained or willful disruption of discussions, talks, or other events, including online discussion;\ndeliberate intimidation;\ncontinued one-on-one communication after requests to cease;\nunwanted photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes;\npattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting or assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others;\ninappropriate physical contact without consent or after a request to stop;\nin virtual settings, inappropriate simulated physical contact used without consent, such as textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub” or emojis representing such contacts;\nstalking or following, including in virtual settings behavior such as persistent unwanted direct messages, sending unwanted pictures or malware links, or logging online activity for harassment purposes;\nthreats of violence or incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm;\nuse of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes;\nunwelcome sexual attention, which can include inappropriate questions of a sexual nature, asking for sexual favors, or repeatedly asking for dates or contact information;\ndeliberate ‘outing’ of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse;\ndeliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names;\nnon-consensual publication of non-harassing private communication, including screenshots of private discussion channels or direct messages;\nforcing or coercing others to join in discussions or vote against their will or without their consent.\n\nWe prioritize marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:\n\n‘reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’;\nreasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you”;\ncommunicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find professional and congenial;\ncriticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions.\n\nIf anyone engages in harassing behavior, the Committee will take action that may include warning the offender or asking them to leave an event or an online channel either temporarily or permanently, or seeking help from law enforcement.\nThis Code of Conduct applies to all people participating in the PPG community, including PPG leadership. It applies to all modes of interaction online including GitHub project repositories, the PPG email list, Slack, virtual meetings, and in person at PPG-hosted events or events officially endorsed by PPG, including social gatherings affiliated with the event.\n\nReporting Guidelines\nThe PPG Code of Conduct Committee is composed of three volunteers, including a member of the PPG Coordinating Committee, who will serve as secretary:\n\nChristopher Krieg (christopher.p.krieg@gmail.com)\nErin Sigel (Erin.Sigel@unh.edu)\nAgustina Yañez (gugu@macn.gov.ar)\nEric Schuettpelz (SchuettpelzE@si.edu), secretary\n\nIf you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please email one or more of the Committee members listed above. If any member of the Committee has a conflict of interest with a report of potential misconduct, they will be recused and will not have access to the content or process of the report followup. At an in-person PPG event, please reach out to anyone named as a member of that event-specific Code of Conduct Committee, or to venue staff or security who will be present throughout the event.\nIf you are planning to attend an upcoming event or join an online channel, and have concerns regarding another individual who may be present, please submit a report as described above. We will work with you to take precautions to ensure your comfort and safety. These precautions may include: providing an escort, preparing onsite event staff, and/or providing on-site contact cell phone numbers for immediate contact. In some cases, we may take action to prevent a harasser from attending the conference.\nThe Code of Conduct Committee will investigate and decide responses to reports of potential misconduct with the aim of making a decision and implementing enforcement as soon as is reasonably possible. We are committed to transparency with our community while upholding the privacy of victims and people who report incidents. Anybody who has been found to have violated the Code of Conduct will be blocked from participation in online discussions, voting, or participation in in-person events. We will publish brief, anonymized summaries of incidents on the forum in a dedicated, read-only category, and will publish on the PPG blog an annual transparency report.\nWe welcome your feedback by email and we thank you for working with us to make PPG a safe, enjoyable, friendly and enriching experience for everyone who participates.\n\n\nLicense and Credits\nThe PPG Code of Conduct has been influenced by and adapted from rOpenSci (https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLicense: CC0-1.0\n\n\nTo the extent possible under law, PPG has waived all copyright and related or neighboring rights to the PPG Code of Conduct."
