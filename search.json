    "text": "Background information\n\nAbout repos\nA repository (or “repo” for short) is a project—a collection of files in a single folder (that may contain subfolders) that is tracked by a piece of version-control software called “git”. Git can be thought of as a fancy “undo” tool—it keeps track of all previous versions of your documents so you can always go back to earlier versions if you want to. GitHub is a web service to host repos in the cloud (online) so that anybody can access them. For our purposes, one need not know anything about git—just think of GitHub as a website that can host our classification and our discussions.\n\n\nAbout issues\nIssues are the tool that GitHub uses to track “to-do” items related to the project. A repo will have a list of issues (like a to-do list), each of which can be open or closed. Open issues still need to be completed. Closed issues have been resolved. Issues can be commented on in a discussion, and the discussion will remain online in perpetuity, even after the issue is closed.\n\n\nAbout markdown\nWhen you create a new issue or add a comment on an existing issue, you can only use plain text (no bold, italics, etc). In order to add formatting, you need to use a syntax called markdown. In markdown, you indicate how the text should be formatted with special characters, such as asterisks around words to be shown in italics. That is why any dialog box to enter text in GitHub has two tabs, “Write” and “Preview”. You enter the text in the “Write” tab and click on “Preview” to see how the formatted text will appear. For more on writing with markdown, see this help doc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: No markdown needed\n\n\n\nIf you don’t want to bother with markdown formatting, you don’t need to use it! Feel free just to write with plain text."

This repo doesn’t have any data in it; it is just to show to how use issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn order to be able to complete each of the steps yourself, you will need a GitHub account (see Setup).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThere will eventually be a real repo set up including the PPG taxonomic data, but at this stage we are only using the demo.\n\n\nThere are three basic things to learn: creating a new issue, searching for an issue, and commenting on an issue."
